This is the project code for the CO600 project. The software is written in Java
and uses the [JGraphX](https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx) library for graph
drawing.

### Dependencies
- Apache Ant
- JDK 7+

### Compiling and Running
Use `ant jar` to build the project and generate an executable jar file.

The program can then be run by executing the jar `ant run` or
`java -jar dist/{jarname}.jar`.

## Testing
The project includes a number of unit tests that can be compiled and run by
executing the command `ant runtests`. This will generate HTML-formatted test
results under the directory `testreports`.
