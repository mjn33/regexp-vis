## Project Structure
The project code can be found under the `regexp_vis` directory, documentation
under `doc`, and miscellaneous tools and scripts under `tools`.

We have also retained some demo code written to test the *Jython* programming
language, as we initially considered using that language so that we could
utilise libraries and syntactic sugar from both Java and Python. This demo can
be found under the `jython_test` directory.
